### **Dandruff (খুশকি) কি?**
Dandruff is one kind of broken pieces of our cells, also called parts of dead cell.
### **Why they Happen?**
Our body and head has many oil-glands (Sebaceous Gland). When these sebaceous glands secretes (grow) excessively, the oil on the head increases, which causes the Melacigia Fungus present in our head to grow excessively.<br>
- Melacigia Fungus grows in dark environment (our head is suitable for this environment) and from the oil of the sebaceous gland one type of fatty acid is formed which the Melacigia fungus likes.
- Besides fatty acids, two other acids are produced from the oil - eracobronic acid and Olio acid, which cause irritation and redness on the scalp.<br>
If it becomes very excessive (grissly), it is called Seboric dermatitis, and in some cases - psoriasis. We have to be sure about the type to get treatment.
